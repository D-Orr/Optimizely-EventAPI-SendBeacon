# Optimizely-EventAPI-SendBeacon

Send events using a browser's sendBeacon API and Optimzely's event api. 

Sends the following payload to Optimizely:
* Account ID
* Event Name as key
* Event ID as entity ID
* Sets Session_ID to AUTO in order to omit the decisions from the event payload.
* Timestamp in milliseconds.

Optimizely will attribute these events to an experiment as long as the event is sent > 30 minutes afterÂ the last network call sent by the Optimizely client JS.

## Purpose

To solve the issue where some click goals on links that leads visitors to a new domain are dropped.

## Usage

1. Copy index.js and paste it in project JS. You can remove lines 5 through 8 if you already implemented the preconnect tag.
2. Send events using ```window.optly.beacon.sendEvent('myEventName');```

For example: 

```
$(document).delegate('a','mousedown',function(){
    window.optly.beacon.sendEvent('myEventName');
});
```
